## Crawford-Group C++ Programming Tutorial in Chemistry

This tutorial is intended to touch on many, but certainly not all, of the fundamentals of C++ programming with an emphasis on quantum chemistry. Although I hope this section will get you started, it is not a substitute for a more complete reference manual. For more C++ language details, you may find [the standard text by Josuttis to be useful](https://www.amazon.com/C-Standard-Library-Tutorial-Reference/dp/0201379260) or try a decent on-line tutorial such as [this one](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) or [this one](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.html).

If you are new to programming, one way to approach this tutorial is to read through "The Fundamentals" list on the wiki first, then proceed with Project #1, using the earlier material as a reference. If you are already experienced with programming, you may be able to start immediately with Project #1. If you already have experience with electronic structure theory programs, then you may be ready for the Hartee-Fock programming project or even more advanced topics.
